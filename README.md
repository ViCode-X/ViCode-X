# 👋 Hello, I’m Vic

🔐 **Cybersecurity Professional in the Making**  
⚙️ **Engineer | Tech Enthusiast | Security-Driven Thinker**

I specialize in **understanding how systems fail, how attackers exploit them, and how defenders stop them**.  
My passion lies in building **secure, resilient, and observable systems** that can withstand modern cyber threats.

With hands-on experience across **networks, endpoints, and cloud-adjacent environments**, I focus heavily on **defensive security (Blue Team operations)**, **security engineering**, and **security automation**—bridging the gap between theory and real-world implementation.
